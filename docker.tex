As noted earlier, the major problems of Spark scalability are
GC overhead and remote memory access, and it can be removed by the Docker container-based 
partitioning approach, which divides the 
original scale-up server into small logical servers that treats the partitioned 
cores as a cluster node and moves shared-memory system workers to distributed system
workers that communicate via message-passing.

This section explains design consideration for architecture and our proposed proof-of-concept 
architecture to solve GC and memory latency.
%We identify two design principles: (1) make shared resource to small size group
%as much as possible, (2) make Spark infrastructure hardware-neutral.

% and small logical servers should 
%run as distributed system concept.

%As result of, the small size CPU groups can mitigate the thread
%serialized problem caused by GC pause time, and these partitioned group may
%only access to local NUMA memory.
%The reason for using partitioning method is that
%Spark library and run-time engine can be bottleneck by GC and remote memory access 
%because Spark has not focused on scale-up server environment.
%However, modification of the spark internals library and the runtime engine is
%difficult.
%To achieve Spark performance scalability, we use the Docker container-based
%partitioning method to eliminate the GC and remote memory access overheads. 
%The fundamental solution for scaling spark make a new designed spark
%libary and runtime engine scale for scale-up server.

\subsection{Design Consideration}

% 파티션닝의 장점 1: GC의 serialization 되는 부분을 줄인다.
%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
%Indeed, GC leads to many of the advantages of high-level languages because of
%an increase in productivity, while it is a double-edged sword because GC pauses may 
%lead a serialized operation.
In order to reduce the GC pause time, minimizing CPU counts is a simple method, 
while it is a double-edged sword because small size of CPU counts may lead 
communicating bottlenecks.
Therefore, the first design consideration is what is 
best-fit CPU counts for reducing the GC pause time.

%a serialized operation.
%but too small size of CPU counts

The second design consideration is the straggler tasks(i.e, tasks take
significantly longer than expected to complete) problem.
Even though small size of partitioning may reduce GC,
its benefit does not come for free because it may cause straggler tasks
problem.
Thus, in order to scale Spark, a straggler monitor and a run-time core injector are needed.

% 파티션닝의 장점 2: DRAM access latency를 최대화 한다.
%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
In addition to finding the best-fit CPU counts and reducing the straggler tasks problem, 
the NUMA locality is next design consideration.
Due to the fact that threads are scheduled by the OS to execute on any core, and 
partitioning approach can prevent to migrate other socket, so it is necessary to 
divide by per-socket.

%Indeed, the modern operating systems have a NUMA balancing feature for
%enhancement of memory locality, but partitioning method can more superior
%performance regarding the large scale-up server(8 socket)~\cite{AutoNUMA}.

Operating systems noise can pose scalability
bottlenecks because modern operating systems have been designed for shared-memory
systems; therefore, the final design consideration is to avoid operating systems
noise.
For example, single address space sharing
problem~\cite{AustinTClements2012RCUBalancedTrees}~\cite{Clements2013RadixVM}
between multi-threaded applications, scheduler bottlenecks~\cite{Lozi2016LSD}
and cache communication
bottlenecks~\cite{SilasBoydWickizerPth}~\cite{Hendler2010FC} are major problems
in manycore scale-up server operating systems.
These problems are caused by sharing resource, so the architecture should consider 
the operating systems noise.

%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
%To satisfy these factors such as GC, NUMA and operating system
%bottlenecks, Spark on scale-up server should run
%as distributed system concept.
%Therefore, we use the partitioning approach that treats the partitioned cores
%as a cluster node and moves shared-memory system workers to distributed system
%workers that communicate via message-passing thereby eliminating GC and remote

This section describes our vision that will accommodate the previous
mentioned design consideration.
Our proposed scalable partitioning architecture is figure~\ref{fig:basic} with the
necessary features.
The left side of figure shows our proposed architecture, and the right side of
figure shows isolated Docker containers and per-socket CPU with memory.

%The main components of the framwork are the decistion engine.
Decision engine is one of the most important features
since all partitioning policy come from the decision engine component.
The basic function of the decision engine chooses whether or not the job
run on the Docker container.
The necessity of the auto-tuner is that performance scalability depending on partitioning
size commonly differs from each server architecture.
To maximized CPU utilization, the straggler monitor and core injector are needed
because straggler tasks prolong job completion times, so the
early finished CPUs should inject to other Docker containers, which
contains the straggler tasks.
