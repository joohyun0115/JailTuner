We propose a concurrent update algorithm, , for update-heavy data structures 
scalable for many-core systems.
To achieve the scalability during process spawning, 
we applied deferred log processing with global log queue and 
update-side absorbing to Linux reverse mapping.
Evaluation results using the AIM7, Exim and lmbench reveal that \deferu shows
better performance up to 2.2 times compared to existing solutions.
\deferu is implemented on to Linux kernel 3.19 and available as open-source from
